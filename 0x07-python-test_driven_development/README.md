Integers addition
a function that adds 2 integers.

Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
Returns an integer: the addition of a and b

Divide a matrix
 a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
div canâ€™t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
Returns a new matrix

Say my name
 a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>

Prototype: def say_my_name(first_name, last_name=""):
first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string

Print square 
a function that prints a square with the character #.

Prototype: def print_square(size):
size is the size length of the square
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer


Text indentation
a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :

Prototype: def text_indentation(text):
text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message text must be a string
There should be no space at the beginning or at the end of each printed line
